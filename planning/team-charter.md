- Our safe word is: Make any animal noise (e.g. quack)
- Issues like this we address immediately.


Pairing:
We do not expect to be pairing all the time!

Good practice:
- TDD!
- Commit often when a test passes.
- Create branch for each feature.
- Pull requests and code reviews.
- Merge with main branch as a team.
- Use slack to discuss team decisions. Use eyes to indicate you have read a message.
- Get told off if you rebase


Anything else that has been an issue in past teams:
- Making sure there is a consensus of confidence
- Being afraid of taking risks with harder problems.
- Making tickets that are too large.
